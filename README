Apache Ant project template with groovy property de-obfuscation.

Simply uses a groovy Ant task to de-obfuscate tagged (obfuscated) properties- it just base64 decodes Ant properties prefixed with 'enc:', when the build script is loaded (Just make sure properties are declared/loaded prior to the groovy property preprocessor task).

"Base64?!?  WTF?!? That's not secure!"
I just need my shizz obfuscated, not encrypted (You could just as easily call the proper crypto API from the groovy task).

"There's already a custom Ant task that does this!"
I didn't find it.  Besides, groovy gives me an entire language in Ant; If I'm going to add external dependencies to my projects, this can do a stack more.

"Your groovy sucks- you could do it in one line with..."
Maybe- But I've never written any groovy prior to this... And, I prefer to write code that I can hand off, and never have to be called upon to explain/maintain.

"Dude, Ant is so, like 2002..."
Sometimes, in the real world, you don't get a choice- You just try to win with what you have.  :)
